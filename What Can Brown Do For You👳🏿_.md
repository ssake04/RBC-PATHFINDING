Scenario: You are recently hired for a delivery company in the most chaotic city called Namaste-Land, where the packages are wild, and the routes are even wilder. Your mission as a delivery man, should you choose to accept it, involves sorting through a mountain of packages. Each box has an urgency level - from "I need this yesterday" (1) to "Eh, whenever's fine" (5) - and a weight that's either "feather-light" or "what did they pack, an elephant?". But wait, there's more! With each delivery, you're playing a real-time game of A* or dijkstra path planning, dodging "dynamic obstacles" - think of them as surprise road closures or pop-up parades or people.So, what can Brown do for you? DO YOUR JOB! or get deported.

Global Challenge Description: ***You can use any programming language you want.***

Local Challenge Description: **\<During Live Demo>**
1) The number of packages can vary from 1-20, urgency (1-5) and weight(1-10)
2) Package and Route Description will be formatted like below
3) The route will vary from each challenger during Demo
4) During presentation one variable will be changed either a new package or route is added,removed or changed
